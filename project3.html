                I was the first non-senior to win the competition to design my school's T-Shirt for the year. As a freshman with crossed fingers, my design managed to make it as the official school's shirt for the year. All faculty and students wore it at De La Salle Santiago Zobel School, making me both shocked and proud of what I managed to make at the time.</h4>
